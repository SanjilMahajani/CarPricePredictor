# Car Price Predictor: Project Overview

- This was a project given to us by my client it aims to create a car price predictor when different features like mileage, transmission, engineSize etc is given.
- Engineered features from the dataset to identify different relationships between the dependent and independent variables.
- Compared different models like Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to find the best model.

## Resources and code used
The data set is from Kaggle where it has different models of Mercedes with their information like mileage, transmisson, price etc

Python Version: 3.7

Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Data Cleaning

I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes:

- ## Data Cleaning

I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

- Handled duplicate values
- Removed unnecessary columns and checked for missing values

  ## EDA

I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables also found out different relationships between data
